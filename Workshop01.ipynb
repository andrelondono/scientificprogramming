In Canopy, it also comes preloaded with a couple libraries (like numpy and matplotlib) that we will use a lot in this course. Try typing `log(e)`, for instance, and you should get `1.0`. Both the function `log` and the number `e` are from the `numpy` library. Or type `pie([1,2,3])`, since `pie` is defined by matplotlib! This can be convenient, but also confusing since many names and variables are already used in ways you might not expect. When writing scripts you'll have to manually import any library you want to use. This little inconvenience is greatly worth the confusion it can save."

    "[Inspired by Harvey Mudd College's CS5 course] Here's an arithmetic game to try your hand at. Your task is to compute each of the numbers, from 1 through 11, using exactly four 4's and simple math operations. You're allowed to use `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `sqrt()` (square root), `factorial()` (factorial), and `%` (modulus). You're also allowed to use `.4` (that's one 4) or `44` (that's two 4's) if you'd like. Just remember, you must use exactly four 4 digits total!\n",

    "As a reminder, four factorial (denoted by $!$ in mathematics) is $4! = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, and the modulus operator (usually denoted by $\\text{mod}$ in mathematics) is the remainder after division. For instance, $\\ 5\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2 = 1$, $\\ 13\\ \\text{mod}\\ 7 = 6$, and $\\ 14\\ \\text{mod}\\ 7 = 0$.\n",
